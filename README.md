1st Landing Page I created using HTML and CSS

HTML-----
I created a boiler plate before I did anything else.
After that I linked the css stylesheet so that I can create a seperate page to style the html.
Once that was finished, I created all of teh elements and nested everything under the appropriate family tree.

CSS-----
Once everything was layed out using the HTML, I created all the sections I needed in the css stylesheet by commenting each section
Then I started working on one section at a time.
Whenever I got stuck I would either referrence my notes, Google, or YouTube to find the appropriate solution.
At the end, I just worked on positioning all of the elements so that everything looked aligned.
